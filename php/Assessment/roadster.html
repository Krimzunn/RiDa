<p> The Tesla Roadster is an upcoming all-electric battery-powered four-seater sports car made by Tesla, Inc.[1] Tesla has said it will be capable of 0 to 97 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in 1.9 seconds,[2] quicker than any street legal production car to date at its announcement in November 2017.[3] The Roadster is the successor to Tesla's first production car, which was the 2008 Roadster.

    Tesla indicates that Roadster sales will begin in 2020, although not before the Tesla Model Y goes on sale. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that higher-performance trim levels will be available beyond the base specifications, including a model with ~10 cold gas thrusters.[4]
