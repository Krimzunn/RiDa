<p> The Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback car, produced by Tesla, Inc., and introduced on June 22, 2012.[10] As of April 23, 2019, the Model S Long Range has an EPA range of 370 miles (600 km), higher than any other electric car.[11]

    The EPA rated the 2017 90D Model S's energy consumption at 3.096 miles per kWh (200.9 watt-hours per kilometer or 32.33 kWh/100 mi or 20.09 kWh/100 km) for a combined fuel economy of 104 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.26 L/100 km or 125 mpgâ€‘imp).[12] In 2016, Tesla updated the design of the Model S to closely match that of the Model X. In January 2019, the following versions were available: 100D and P100D.[13] In April 2019, Tesla dropped the kWh branding in favor of the three named versions: Standard Range, Long Range, and Performance.[14] In July 2019, Tesla discontinued the Standard Range configuration, leaving just the Long Range and Performance versions available.[15]
    
    In 2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new car sales ranking in any country, twice leading in Norway, in September and December 2013[16][17][18][19] and also in Denmark in December 2015.[20] Global Model S sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018.[21][22][23][24] The U.S. is its leading market, with about 140,000 units delivered through December 2018.[25]
    
    The Tesla Model S was the top selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016,[26][27][28] and by the end of 2018 continued to rank as the second most-sold electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf.[21] The December 2017 Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey had the Tesla Model S at the top.[29] In 2019 in the U.S., Motor Trend magazine named it the ultimate car of the year over its 70 year history.</p>
